# Regex-Tutorial
Computer Science for JavaScript Challenge Regex Tutorial

It is a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary
The following snippets of code will be used throughout this tutorial to give specific examples on how the different components of regex can be used. A common use for this code is for validation, to make sure that an email follows the correct format.

Matching a Hex Value:

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

Matching an Email: 
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

Matching a URL: 
`/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`

Matching an HTML Tag: 
`/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/`

## Regex Components

### Anchors

`/`^`#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})`$`/`

The anchor is a term which defines the start and end of the expression. They can be used to “anchor” the regex match at a certain position. The caret `^` matches the position before the first character in the string. Applying `^a` to `abc` matches `a`. `^b` does not match `abc` at all, because the `b` cannot be matched right after the start of the string, matched by `^`. See below for the inside view of the regex engine.
Similarly, `$` matches right after the last character in the string. `c$` matches `c` in `abc`, while `a$` does not match at all.

### Quantifiers

`/^#`?`([a-f0-9]`{6}`|[a-f0-9]`{3}`)$/`

Quantifiers are used to communicate how many characters are expected. Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found. By default, quantifiers are greedy, and will match as many characters as possible. If the "`,+,?,{}`" characters are found within regular expressions, they are considered quantifiers. The `?` indicates the expression to match `0` or `1`time. As mentioned in the summary above because there are 2 types of formats we'll use the or operator to distinguish which format we are using. In our Hex Value regular expression we have `{6}` (Hex Triplet Format) and `{3}` (Shorthand Hex Format), this indicates that the length of the component preceding these quantifiers should be `6` for `{6}` and `3` for `{3}`.

### Grouping Constructs

Grouping constructs delineate the subexpressions of a regular expression and capture the substrings of an input string.

### Bracket Expressions

`/^#?`([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})`$/`

Matches any character in the square brackets. For example 	`[nN]` `[oO]` matches `no`, `nO`, `No`, and `NO`.
`gr[ae]y` matches both spellings of the word `'grey'`; that is, `gray` and `grey`.

### Character Classes

`/^#?(`[a-f0-9]`{6}|`[a-f0-9]{3}`)$/`

Character classes are components within our regular expression that tells us what type of characters to expect. In our example our character classes are confined within brackets `[]`. For our example we have 2 character classes: `[a-f0-9]` and `[a-f0-9]` which searches for the same values. We will be breaking down what the characters are searching within these character classes. `a-f` searches for letters `a-f` and `0-9` searches for digits `0-9`.

### The OR Operator

The 'OR' Operator is not present in our example code for matching against an email, so for now, in order to talk about the OR Operator, we will take a look at the following code for matching against a hex code:

`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

What we see here, is an expression for matching a hex code that uses the OR Operator. What this operator does is look for a matching string where it starts with a # first followed by one of the following:

`[a-f0-9]{6}` this will match a 6 character long string which contains a combination of a-f letters and 0-9 numbers.

| this is the OR Operator

`[a-f0-9]{3}` this will match a 3 character long string that contains a combination of a-f letters and 0-9 numbers.

Notice both of the above examples are referencing the same character class `[a-f0-9]`. This is because the OR Operator is looking for a match that starts with a # and then either a 6 character long string or a 3 character long string. It does not matter which one it is, as long as it starts with a # and then either a 6 character long string or a 3 character long string.

### Flags

A flag is not used in the matching email code in this tutorial. A regular expression typically looks like this:

`/pattern/flags`

Where the slashes denote where the regular expresssion starts and ends. A flag can be used after the slash to provide more guidelines for matching. The flags are:

- `g` which stands for "global" which will allow for matching all the instances within a string that follow the matching guidelines set in the regular expression.
- `m` which stands for "multiline" which will search line by line rather than searching through a string as a whole.
- `i` which stands for "insensitive" will make the regular expression case-insensitive, so capitals and lower-case letters will not deture the matching.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

`/^#`?`([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/`

A greedy match tries to match an element as many times as possible. Whereas, a lazy match tries to match an element as few times as possible. In our example we have `?` which signifies lazy quantifier. This is referred to a lazy quantifier because it causes the regular expression engine to match as few occurances as possible. We can simply turn this lazy match into a greedy one by adding a `?`.
